                                          Today Learning:
 Json local Loading and extracting.

 If you use json file which is local to the other file means data
 is not come from a API source than in this case we use "root service" library
service.dart package

And for encoding use dart-decode for for convert string output to
again as JSON data for the further use

note  :
hot reload only call the build method where hot restart only call the initState method and build method together.


factory is type of constructor which is automatically initialize the variables ==> category.dart
- to see the change you have to call the setState method

// use dart data class generator to generate value like this:
factory Item.fromMap(Map<String, dynamic> map) {
    return Item(
      id: map["id"],
      name: map["name"],
      desc: map["desc"],
      price: map["price"],
      color: map["color"],
      image: map["image"],
    );
based on the class property because sometime class are too large and you can't do it that easy.
