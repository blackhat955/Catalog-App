Type of data type :
DAY 1=============================================>
1: bool
2: var_ this variable is responsible for the accept all type of data type which can be use
3: string - this is another data type which can be use to contain or return string values
4:double- this variable type is responsible for holding double values
5: num - this data type basically hold all type of number whether it is a integer or double value
6: int - data type is use to store the  integer value

# important to note :

(Constructor)==> is used to pass the data to the app

Varibale type const and final . if you have a list which is final type than ypu can able the
add more element but if you have a list is type than you won't able to add more element.


what is scaffold?
this is serve as header, body and footer in HTML you can take refrence from there


===> for bold cursor you can press numlk key+ 0 in the keyboard together.


Day 2===============================================================>

# Scaffold is main structure of the app means main item where we can draw
Widget build(BuildContext context) ==> this mean we are return a widget basically Widget is a return type
here Widget is return type and build is a function
if we write int in place of widget than it return widget which is type int similarly for string and void .

Another important thing ==> Widget build({BuildContext context}) if we use curly braces inside the function bulid that means we can pass parameter but the are compulsory but if there is not any braces than it will must compulsory

stateless amd stateful widget ====>>

for example if you are on the login screen and you want some cahnges on that screen without changing the page
then we should think about the stateful widget because this is souly responsible for the changes.
mean it act like something is alive.
for the stateless after done a task we can move on teh new screen which is a new page and yu nothing worrey about it.


note a new important thing ::
to make thing private in dart _ just used underscore to do this like _LoginPage here the login page is now private.


<=================================================day 6=====================================================>

to apply ripple effect with inkwell we have to a very important thing.

To solve this issue you can use Ink class instead of container class and they work same and it
also work well with Inkwell class.

other soloution:
you can wrap Inkwell class with material class and problem solve but if you observe then you find the issue still be the same
now you can remove decoration you given to AnimatedContainer and give to the material and you see now the issue is resolve.

give decoration to the material only do not give it to AnimatedContainer
<=================================================day 9=================================================>

postion set by parents and child should follow it .
 like if we have two container
 container 1
 container 2
 and if you set position for container 1 which is parents of container 2
 then it will take parent height and width default even we define a different
 height and with for it.


 Widget are immutable like container.

 Basically in flutter we have tree main component on which work.
 1.Widget tree --- writing for this (code)
 2.Element Tree
 3.Render tree ---painting on canva or on screen
